## Getting Started

This application was made using [react-create-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and can be started by using the command `yarn start` or `npm start`.

From there you can test out the User Registration form. By default the app will use the form from `src/FormStart.jsx`. If you'd like to check out the finished form you can find it within `src/FormEnd.jsx`.
